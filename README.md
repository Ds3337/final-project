# Research background
Production life has changed dramatically from 2000 to 2019. As an important force over the cultural field, we wonder how have people\'s preferences for music changed in these two decades, so we choose to research this topic.
# Dataset description
Source: [Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019)

This dataset contains audio statistics of the nearly top 2000 songs on Spotify from 2000-2019. The data contains about 18 columns each describing the song and it's qualities.
# Data treating
We first checked for the missing data in this dataset and found none. Then we checked for the duplicate data and eliminated them in the dataset. Since we want to compare the data between two decades in the reasearch, we deleted the pre-2000 and post-2019 data to make the results more accurate, leaving only the data of the 20-year period.
# Research problems
- What are the changes in the popularity of different genres over the two decades?
- The importance of danceability and energy to the popularity of songs.
- Average duration of songs is decreasing.
- There is no completely positive correlation between the average popularity and the total popularity of the aritists.
